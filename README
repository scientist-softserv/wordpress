as soon as you dc up you need to open
docker desktop and drop into the web
containers terminal && `echo "Mutex posixsem" >> /opt/bitnami/apache2/conf/httpd.conf`

Once up you should navigate to `http://localhost/` or `http://localhost/wp-login.php`

Once the plugin is activated you will navigate to the side menu under all-in-One WP Migration and click the subnav item `Import` and import your backed up .wpress file and follow the directions untill it is restored.

If you are updating from a version lower than wordpress 6 you may need to rename the Plugins folder. You can so this by dropping into the running containers terminal and `docker cp ./path/to/file-name.php ./file-name.php` and you can update the file and copy it back to the container with `docker cp ./file-name.php ./path/to/file-name.php`.
